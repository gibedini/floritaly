Description: Access the Checklist of Italian vascular flora, bundled as dataframe 
    in three forms: all names (accepted and synonyms), accepted names with associated data, 
    and parsed names. In addition, it offers the \code{namestand()} function 
    to standardise a set of names against the Checklist, and the \code{ckl_datalink} 
    function to link scientific names to the regional distribution data included in 
    the Checklist.
